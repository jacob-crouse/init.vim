Jake Crouse's Neovim Configuration File
=======================================

I added this config file to git so my neovim configuration would be available online and be kept up-to-date so I would be able to pull this for any computer that I decide in the future needs to run the Neovim text editor.


## Planned Improvements

I plan to add a script here that can be run with the `./setup` command which will automatically install all dependencies for all the plugins in use, but this hasn't happed yet. Stay tuned!
